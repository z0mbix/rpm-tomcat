Tomcat RPM Build
================

This repo is for building a Tomcat RPM from the official tarball release.

It installs to: **/opt/tomcat**
Main logs in: **/var/log/tomcat**


Tested with Tomcat 8 on CentOS 6.x

You need curl and fpm to build this

TODO:

- Test with other Tomcat versions and look in to RHEL/CentOS 7.x packaging with systemd
